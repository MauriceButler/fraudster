Simple mocking of require statements in Node

# Why

I have been using [mockery](https://github.com/mfncooper/mockery) heavily for some time.

I like how it works, but have always wanted to change how it was written and tested and be able to implement changes quickly.

Mainly make it instanceable so that mocks do not leak into other tests;


# Status

Work in progress...
